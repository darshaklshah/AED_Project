health-event-report-system
==========================

This is final project of Application Engineering class in 2015 fall at Northeastern University.

Requirement:
The objective here is to build an application to enable hospitals, clinics, clinicians, and patients to report medical safety problems in an anonymous way. Medical errors are responsive for so many deaths and injuries world-wide. The knowledge developed is used to define best practices that help avoid clinical errors. These include better clinical procedures, improved medical devices, and more training of the clinical staff. The reported adverse events must encompass all kinds of medical categories to make it easier for organize make effective use of the gathered data. The system must be world-wide and allow for access from any country where users can report adverse events in their locality. Look up the “safety Rule” on the HHS website.

3)	Participants include hospitals, clinics, government agencies and individuals
4)	Adverse events of all kinds from devices, medical procedures, human errors, etc.
5)	BI reporting of error patterns detecting chronic violators by regions, practice, etc
6)	Anonymity of reporters
